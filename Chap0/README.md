Rust structs with python Interface - introduce how to construct python tool with rust backend. 

# Materials: 

# 1. Building Basic Rust Executable (`hello_world`)

# 2. Build Basic Rust Package using Cargo (`cargo_hello_world`)

# 3. Building Python Function by Rust (`add`)

# 4. Building Python Object by Rust (`logic_unit` with methods: `add`, `mul`.)
